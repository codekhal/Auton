I created this project with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## To run on your local machine

Step 1: ` git clone https://github.com/codekhal/Auton.git`
<br>
Step 2: ` cd Auton`

Step 3: #### `npm start`

Run the app in the development mode.
<br> 
#### Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

#### `npm test`

It launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
